# e-commerce-backend

Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my Backend E-commerce App.

[Here is a link to the demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zW5mv0_h1RD9hgu4VqD2K9Yp7yLWm7_4/view)

In the Demo it shows you how to Create you data base, seed it, and then run it on a local server. After that you can do your CRUD operations on a insomnia or anyother software that maniuplates and accesses data. 

When you clone this repo make sure to add a .env file with:
```
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER='*your username here*'
DB_PW=''
```
Without this the app will not connect to localhost.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my demos, code, and any giving feedback!
